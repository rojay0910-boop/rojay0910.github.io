## About Me

I am a data analysis learner and practitioner, currently building a structured portfolio through hands-on projects.  
My work emphasizes:

- Translating raw data into **clear, explainable insights**
- Using **SQL, Python, Excel, and Tableau** appropriately based on the question
- Designing analyses that are **portfolio-ready**, not just technically correct

  Analyze file-type distributions and repository size patterns using BigQuery SQL.  
  → Focus on CTEs, window functions, and query design.

### Python Projects
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using pandas and matplotlib.

### Visualization Projects
- **Tableau Dashboards**  
  Interactive dashboards designed to answer specific research questions clearly.

> Each project includes:
> - Research questions  
> - Dataset description  
> - Analysis steps  
> - Visualizations  
> - Key insights & limitations
